# raytracing
Simple raytracer

This is a simple raytracer that was the coursework of one of my classes in the Spring semester of 2019-2020 at Tsinghua University. Some of the code was already provided by the TAs, then I followed "Raytracing in One Weekend", but I added a great amount of code to it as well.

Currently supports Distributed Raytracing, and can render spheres, polygons, meshes, bezier and b-spline curves, revolutional bezier surfaces, and so on.

Plan on making the code tidier, and then add photon mapping.
