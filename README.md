## Summary

This is a simple raytracer that was the coursework of one of my classes in the Spring semester of 2019-2020 at Tsinghua University. Some of the code was already provided by the TAs, then I followed "Raytracing in One Weekend", but I added a great amount of code to it as well.

Currently supports **distributed raytracing with super-sampling anti-aliasing**, and can render spheres, polygons, meshes, bezier and b-spline curves, revolutional bezier surfaces, and so on.

**Revolutional bezier surface** is arguably the most difficult part to implement in this project.

## Future plans

1. Better project name
2. Making the code tidier, especially finish scene parsing logics.

2. Add photon mapping.
3. Add directional light.
4. Add UI, and allow moving the camera in a viewport.
5. Allow user to change rendering settings.
